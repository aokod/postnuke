XHTML support for themes in PostNuke...

        Nothing special is required to support XHTML in themes.
        Since all header information is already applied, the theme
        simply decorates the screen.  As long as the output is
        clean XHTML, it will display in both HTML 4.0 and XHTML 1.1
        compatible browsers.
