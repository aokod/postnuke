SeaBreeze v2

This theme was designed by me, Vanessa of Designs4Nuke.com.
It was inspired by the Pacific Ocean in San Diego.  :-)  
and was created with simplicity in mind. 

The theme has been tested on several browsers and I know it works
in Netscape 4.7, Netscape 6.0 IE 5.0 on both Macs and PC's.

If you experience a problem with a specific browser please 
let me know so we can fix or if you fix it then send me the fix 
and I'll include it in an update/patch.

Thanks to everyone in the Postnuke community. This has really
been a group effort and I'm proud to be part of such a wonderful
helpful community of people.  

And a special thanks goes to Marty Vance aka Dracos for 
helping me with the Netscape style sheets and 
creating the stats bar graphic.
