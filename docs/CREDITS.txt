PostNuke Release Credits
==============================================

PostNuke is, as with many successful open-source products, a huge
collaborative effort spanning many diverse talents from across the 
globe.  The list below gives an idea of some of the people that have 
helped in creating the PostNuke Release, and also
those in other areas such as support and documentation.

PostNuke was originally a fork of PHPNuke by Francisco Burzi, and many of
the concepts in that program survive even though the code does not.  We (and
PHPNuke, of course) were also influenced by earlier products such as slash and
thatware, and I'm sure that we could trace the lineage back to the earliest
weblog if we wanted to.  Open source at work is taking the best ideas floating
around the web and building a product out of them, and that's where we hope
that PostNuke is heading.

Please note that this credits file only contains credits relevant to
the release of PostNuke.  For full credits, please refer 
to the file docs/previouscredits.txt. For credits for the many third party 
applications and tools used to build PostNuke please refer to the file
docs/thirdpartycredits.txt

PostNuke Translations
=====================

Thanks also go to the many translation teams and individual translators 
around the world who translate PostNuke. Without translations, PostNuke 
could not be a truly multinational project with contributions from around 
the world.

PostNuke's pnLanguages translation/localization project can be found
at http://noc.postnuke.com/projects/pnlanguages, where you can download
the latest versions of language packs available for PostNuke.

PostNuke Users
==============

All users of the PostNuke project deserve a mention here.  In one
way or another, everyone has contributed to PostNuke, either by
downloading and installing the system, or in other ways, submitting
bug fixes, helping in the forums or in many many different ways.
