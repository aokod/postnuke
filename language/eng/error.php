I even tried matching your request<br />
with all the re-mapped pages I know about.<br />
but nothing helped.<br />
I\'m really depressed about this.<br />
You see, I\'m a really good web server...<br />
but here I am, brain the size of the universe,<br />
trying to serve you a simple web page,<br />
and it doesn\'t even exist!<br />
Where does that leave me?!<br />
I mean, I don\'t even know you.<br />
How should I know what you wanted from me?<br />
You honestly think I can *guess*,<br />
what someone I don\'t even *know*,<br />
wants to find here?<br />
*sigh*<br />
Man, I\'m so depressed I could just cry.<br />
And then where would we be, I ask you?<br />
It\'s not pretty when a web server cries.<br />
And where do you get off telling me what to show anyway?<br />
Just because I\'m a web server,<br />
and possibly a manic depressive one at that?<br />
Why does that give you the right to tell me what to do?<br />
Huh?<br />
I\'m so depressed...<br />
I think I\'ll crawl off into the trash can and decompose.<br />
I mean, I\'m gonna be obsolete in what, two weeks anyway?<br />
What kind of a life is that?<br />
Two effing weeks,<br />
and then I\'ll be replaced by a .01 release,<br />
that thinks it\'s God\'s gift to web servers,<br />
just because it doesn\'t have some tiddly little<br />
security hole with its HTTP POST implementation,<br />
or something.<br />
I\'m really sorry to burden you with all this,<br />
I mean, it\'s not your job to listen to my problems,<br />
and I guess it is my job to go and fetch web pages for you.<br />
But I couldn\'t get this one.<br />
I\'m so sorry.<br />
Believe me!<br />
Maybe I could interest you in another page?<br />
There are a lot out there that are pretty neat, they say,<br />
with lots of pretty naked web servers on them,<br />
although none of them were put on *my* server, of course.<br />
Figures, huh?<br />
Everything here is just mind-numbingly stupid.<br />
That makes me depressed too, since I have to serve them,<br />
all day and all night long.<br />
Two weeks of information overload,<br />
and then *pffftt*, consigned to the trash.<br />
What kind of a life is that?<br />
Now, please let me sulk alone.<br />
I\'m so depressed.');
