Sniffer Module

The initial inspiration for this module came from the module of the same name is xaraya but 
after an initial glance at the logic I realised that this module only exposed a small subset 
of the information available from phpSniff so a complete, from the ground up, rewrite was 
required.

Full credits for the original module go to Frank Besler. Full credit for the heart of this 
module (phpSniff) goes to Roger Raymond (he of PostCalendar).
