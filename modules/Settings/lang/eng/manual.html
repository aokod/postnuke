This is the main configuration section of your site. You will specify all the mandatory configuration parameters for your site to be functional here.
<br><br>

<b>Site Name:</b> Your site needs a name! Well, this is where you set it!<br><br>

<font color="Red" size="+1"><li><b>General Site Info</b></font><font color="Black" size="2"><br><br>

<b>Site URL:</b> Enter the full URL to your website here, including the <i>http://</i>. Don NOT include a trailing slash (/).<br>
<i>Samples:</i>
<ul>
http://www.yourdomain.com<br><br>
<i>or</i><br><br>
http://www.yourdomain.com/~username/MySite
</ul>

<b>Site Logo:</b> This logo will be located in the <i>images</i>
directory, and is used to be displayed just in the <i>Printer
Friendly Page</i>. The best option is a grayscale graphic with
the logo of your site. This logo has nothing to do with your
theme logo which you need to include for each theme.<br><br>

<b>Site Slogan:</b> If you have a slogan for your site, you may enter it here. This slogan will be added to the title of every page and will be displayed on every page as well, but only if the theme you are using is coded for it (chances are that it is).<br><br>

<b>Site Start Date:</b> You can enter the date you website went live here. This information will
be visible only in the stats page (stats.php).<br><br>

<b>Administrator Email:</b> Enter the email address for the main admin or webmaster. This is the email address that emails are sent when users try to contact you.

<b>Number of Items in TOP Page:</b> You have a TOP page (top.php)
where the visitors can view what are the top read articles, most
commented, the best poll, etc. If you select, for example, <i>10</i> then you will have a TOP "10" page.<br><br>

<b>Stories Number in the Home:</b> Enter the number of stories you would like to display on the front page. A common number is 10, but you may also want to use 5 (or any other number). Remember that registered users
can change this value to whatever they want. So, this is just a
default value for non-registered users.<br><br>

<b>Stories in Old Articles Box:</b> On the front page
you can see a box called <i>Past Articles</i>, if you have it activated that is. This is the
number of stories to show in that box.<br><br>

<b>Activate Ultramode?:</b> Ultramode is a plain text file located
in the root directory of your site. By default this value is set to <i>No</i>,
if you change this be sure to "chmod 666" the file in order to write it.
In this file will be the last 10 news headlines of your site with
assorted info, fields (or news) separated by %%. This file is used
to let other sites "syndicate" your news on their website. The best method is
to deactivate this feature and use <i>backend.php</i> file, which is in
RDF/XML format.<br><br>

<b>Allow Anonymous to Post?:</b> If you would like to allow anonymous (non-registered) users to post comments, select <i>Yes</i>, otherwise select <i>No</i>.<br><br>

<b>Default Theme for your site:</b> Select the default theme for your entire site.
Registered users have the ability to change the theme as well. This value is valid
only for non-registered users, or registered users who have not selected a theme.<br><br>

<b>Select Language for your site:</b> No explanation is needed here, select the default language for your site.<br><br>

<b>Locale Time Format:</b> Select the Locale format you want. Locales are little databases
with the date, time, and other stuff in our language. Some Unix/Linux system has the locales
already installed, if this is the case just select the one you want, otherwise install
the Locales you need. Usualy, the Locales are installed under the <i>/usr/share/locale</i>
directory.<br><br></font>

<font color="Red" size="+1"><li><b>Banners</b></font><font color="Black" size="2"><br><br>

PHP-Nuke has incorporated a basic banners system. If you active the banners, then reload the
Administration page you will see a new menu called <i>Banner Administration</i> where you
can configure whatever you want. If you want to use another banners software,
just select <i>No</i>.<br><br>

<b>Your IP to not count the hits:</b> If you select <i>Yes</i> to the above question, you
need to put your IP number to prevent the system from counting your hits for the banner displayed.
If you are an administrator(umm, you should be :p) you will have a high number of pages views on your own site, so if
a client pays you for impressions it would not be fair to count you. Be honest here!<br><br></font>

<font color="Red" size="+1"><li><b>Footer Messages</b></font><font color="Black" size="2"><br><br>

<b>Foot Lines 1, 2, 3 and 4:</b> This is the text(can be HTML) that will be shown
in the footer of each page. Usualy here is where you would put "powered by" buttons,
copyright messages, webmaster email, etc. If you want only 2 or 3 lines instead of 4, then just fill out the ones you would like to use. Please use them in order though (ie. don't use 1 and 2, leave 3 blank and then use 4)!<br><br></font>
