This page will show you who has been linking to your site.<br><br>

This list tends to get large quite fast, so you might want to delete them often. You
can also deactivate this feature in the module <i>Configuration</i>.<br><br>

You can delete the referers when you want by clicking on the <i>Delete Referrers</i> button<br><br>
